mysql-criminal-record
=====================

This is a course project in DBMS (Data Base Management System). We have made a simple php/html/mysql webpage for criminal record.
Individual files name are self explanatory. They handle different services like __Adding a crime__ __Adding a person__ __checking login__, __searching__ etc

There is [db.rtf](db.rtf), [db_mysql.rtf](db_mysql.rtf) file which will help you in setting the server(mysql database).

You can upload image also in the database and can see it with each criminal record. This was the toughest part in this simple project. image is stored as a binary data in mysql database.
